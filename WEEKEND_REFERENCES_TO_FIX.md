# Weekend References That Need to be Removed

You mentioned you don't know why the site mentions "weekend" anything. Here are all the places it still appears:

## Need to Change:

1. **Line 6** - Title: "Help End Weekend Hunger" 
   → Change to: "Help End Childhood Hunger" or "Help Feed Atlanta Children"

2. **Line 7** - Meta description: "nutritious weekend meals"
   → Change to: "nutritious meals"

3. **Line 8** - OG Title: "Every Child Deserves a Full Weekend"
   → Change to: "Every Child Deserves Enough Food"

4. **Line 471** - H1: "Every Child Deserves a Full Weekend"
   → Change to: "Every Child Deserves Enough Food"

5. **Line 482** - Counter text: "weekend meals provided"
   → Change to: "meals provided"

6. **Line 517** - Bridge message: "becomes a weekend lifeline"
   → Change to: "becomes a lifeline"

7. **Line 576** - Process description: "to weekend meals"
   → Change to: "to nutritious meals"

8. **Line 589** - Packing description: "weekend food bags"
   → Change to: "nutritious food bags"

## Quick Fix Approach:
Replace all instances of "weekend" with general food/meal language that focuses on feeding kids, not specifically weekends.

Would you like me to make these changes for you?
