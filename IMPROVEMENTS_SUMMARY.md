# Website Improvement Recommendations for The Sandwich Project

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Broken Logo Image
**File:** `amazonwishlistlandingpage.html` (line 514)  
**Issue:** Logo path points to non-existent directory `LOGOS/TSP_reverse_transparent.png`  
**Fix:** Either:
- Create the LOGOS directory and add the logo file, OR
- Update the path to point to an existing image, OR
- Use a placeholder or base64-encoded image

### 2. Placeholder Amazon Wishlist Link
**File:** `amazonwishlistbridge.html` (line 522)  
**Issue:** Link contains placeholder `YOURID` instead of actual wishlist ID  
**Fix:** Replace `https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YOURID` with the actual wishlist URL

### 3. Broken "View on Amazon" Links
**File:** `amazonwishlistbridge.html` (lines 541, 549, 557)  
**Issue:** Multiple links point to `#` instead of actual product pages  
**Fix:** Add real Amazon product URLs or proper wishlist links

## Content Enhancements

### 4. Add Success Stories/Testimonials Section
**Current:** No social proof from recipients or donors  
**Suggestion:** Add a carousel or section featuring:
- Quotes from families helped
- Volunteer testimonials
- Photos of delivery events (with permission)
- Impact numbers and milestones

**Example structure:**
```html
<section class="testimonials">
    <h2>Stories from Our Community</h2>
    <div class="testimonial-card">
        <quote>"This program helped feed my kids over the weekend when we had nothing."</quote>
        <cite>- Parent, Atlanta Public Schools</cite>
    </div>
</section>
```

### 5. Add Progress/Impact Tracking
**Current:** Static impact numbers  
**Suggestion:** Add dynamic progress bars showing:
- Goal vs. actual donations for current month
- Items needed vs. items received
- Total meals delivered this month/year
- Number of families served

**Visual suggestion:**
```html
<div class="progress-goal">
    <h3>December Goal: 1,000 Protein Bars</h3>
    <div class="progress-bar">
        <div class="progress-fill" style="width: 65%">65%</div>
    </div>
    <p>650 bars donated | 350 more needed</p>
</div>
```

### 6. Add "How Your Donation Helps" Section
**Current:** Impact is mentioned but not detailed  
**Suggestion:** Add specific examples:
- "$10 buys 5 protein bars = 5 weekend meals for kids"
- Visual breakdown showing donation tiers
- Real photos of items being packed into bags

---

## User Experience Improvements

### 7. Add Search/Filter Functionality
**Current:** Items are sorted by priority but hard to find specific items  
**Suggestion:**
- Add a search bar for product names
- Filter by price range
- Filter by category with live counts
- Sort by price, name, or need level

### 8. Improve Mobile Experience
**Current:** Mobile responsive but could be better  
**Suggestion:**
- Larger tap targets on mobile (minimum 44x44px)
- Sticky "Donate" button that follows scroll on mobile
- Simplified navigation for small screens
- Optimized image sizes for mobile loading

### 9. Add Item Wishlist/Favorites
**Suggestion:** Allow users to:
- Create a personal shopping list of items they want to donate

## Visual & Design Enhancements

### 10. Add Animations & Micro-interactions

**Suggestions:**

- Smooth scroll-to-top button
- Count-up animations for impact numbers
- Celebration animations when donation thresholds are met

### 11. Add Photo Gallery

## Technical Improvements

### 13. Performance Optimization

**Suggestions:**

- Add lazy loading to images below the fold
- Consider splitting CSS into critical/non-critical
- Add caching headers

### 14. SEO Enhancements
**Current:** Basic meta tags present  
**Suggestions:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Donate to The Sandwich Project - Bridge the weekend hunger gap for Atlanta families. Every donation provides nutritious meals for kids facing food insecurity.">
<meta name="keywords" content="food insecurity, Atlanta, charity, children, weekend hunger">
<meta property="og:title" content="Support The Sandwich Project">
