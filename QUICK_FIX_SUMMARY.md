# Quick Fix Applied

## ✅ Fixed Amazon Wishlist Link

**Problem:** The Amazon wishlist button had placeholder `YOURID` instead of the real wishlist ID.

**Solution:** Updated line 529 to use the correct Amazon wishlist URL:
```html
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XRSQ9EDIIIWV?ref_=wl_share" target="_blank" class="amazon-btn">
```

**Result:** The "Shop Our Amazon Wishlist" button now links to your actual Amazon wishlist!

## Answer to Your Question

**The CORRECT link is:** `https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XRSQ9EDIIIWV?ref_=wl_share`

This is what I used in line 529. The placeholder `YOURID` was incorrect.
